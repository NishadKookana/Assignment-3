Give a number= 2
Give a number= 3
[2, 3, 5]
Give y to continue and n to stop going further-y
[2, 3, 5, 8]
Give y to continue and n to stop going further-y
[2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Give y to continue and n to stop going further-y
[2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
Give y to continue and n to stop going further-y
[2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
Give y to continue and n to stop going further-n
Now we got a list having a fibonacci series=  [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
Average of the sequence=  12.285714285714286
Done!
